# ==============================================
# FILE: _quarto.yml
# PROJECT: Visualization Journal (CSC 477 / GCSC 577)
# AUTHOR: Salmon Riaz
# VERSION: 1.0.0
# DATE: 2026-02-18
# CHANGE: Initial website structure aligned to class "Course Notebook" layout (Week 01 ready).
#
# PURPOSE
# - Creates a Quarto WEBSITE with a left sidebar like the common class template
# - Builds to /docs (GitHub Pages friendly)
# - Adds navigation sections: Home, Weeks, Labs, Group Work
#
# NOTES
# - Week 01 includes R-only chunks (matches the common Week 01 template style).
# - When you later mix R + Python in the same .qmd, you must use reticulate::use_python()
#   at the top of that specific file (knitr/reticulate behavior).
