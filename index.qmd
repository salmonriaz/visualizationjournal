## Welcome

This site is my course notebook for **CSC 477 / GCSC 577 (Visualizations)**.
It contains weekly notes, small experiments, and visualizations created throughout the semester.

### How to use this notebook

- Use the **sidebar** to navigate to each week.
- Each week includes notes, code, and results.
- For now, Week 01 is fully set up; the other weeks are placeholders that we will fill in as we catch up.
